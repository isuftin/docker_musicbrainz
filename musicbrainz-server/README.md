# musicbrainz-server Container

Prerequisites
-------------

1. Ensure you have an accessible Postgres server provisioned as per [here](../README.md).

2. *Optional:* As the MusicBrainz install pulls down a pile of packages and Perl modules, I highly suggest setting up an HTTP caching proxy (like Squid) and modify the Dockerfile appropriately (see commented-out lines) to use it.  This will save you lots of time on re-runs.  (*Note:* I couldn't get `npm install` to work correctly through my Squid proxy.  Any advice would be appreciated.)

Build Instructions
------------------
1. Modify `DBDefs.pm` to match your environment.  By default it's configured appropriately for the related `musicbrainz-postgres` container linked according to the *Usage Instructions* below.

2. Build `musicbrainz-server` container (this will take a while)

```
docker build -t musicbrainz-server .
```

Usage Instructions
------------------

The base recommended Docker command to run this container is...

```
docker run -i -t --rm --name musicbrainz-server musicbrainz-server ...
```

If you're using the related `musicbrainz-postgres` (or another Postgres) container you can link your `musicbrainz-server` containers to it to simplify networking.  Assuming the Postgres container is called `musicbrainz-postgres`, your base Docker parameters would look something like this:

```
docker run -i -t --rm --name musicbrainz-server --link musicbrainz-postgres:db musicbrainz-server ...
```

This will let you refer to the Postgres container as `db` in `DBDefs.pm` and elsewhere in your `musicbrainz-server` container.

The rest of the instructions will refer to whatever your base command is as `<BASE COMMAND>`.


### Intantiate MusicBrainz database

Download and load latest database dump (recommended):

```
<BASE COMMAND> /opt/musicbrainz/loaddb.sh
```

The `loaddb.sh` script will locate and pull down the latest MusicBrainz database dump from ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/ to `/tmp` inside the container.  As these files total upwards of 5GB and extract to much larger than that, I highly recommend mounting a host path to `/tmp` to improve performance and keep the container size small (i.e. `-v /some/host/path:tmp`).

If you just want to initialize a clean database (not recommended):

```
<BASE COMMAND> /opt/musicbrainz/loaddb.sh --clean
```

### Update MusicBrainz database

Update the MusicBrainz database with replication packets:

```
<BASE COMMAND> /opt/musicbrainz/updatedb.sh
```

You run this at any time, even with a live `musicbrainz-server` container running separately (although I wouldn't run more than one update at once...I don't know how the DB will handle that.)

### Start MusicBrainz Server

```
<BASE COMMAND> /opt/musicbrainz/start.sh
```

Don't forget to add `-p 5000:5000` (or whatever you've configured the web port to be) to your `<BASE COMMAND>` before the container name!
