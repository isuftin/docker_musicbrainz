# musicbrainz-postgres Container

Prerequisites
-------------

1. *Optional:* I suggest provisioning at least 60GB of host-based disk to mount into your `musicbrainz-postgres` container for the Postgres DB files, instead of storing them inside the container, for performance and usability.

2. *Optional:* As the MusicBrainz install pulls down a pile of packages and Perl modules, I highly suggest setting up an HTTP caching proxy (like Squid) and modify the Dockerfile appropriately (see commented-out lines) to use it.  This will save you lots of time on re-runs.

Build Instructions
------------------
1. Build `musicbrainz-postgres` container:

```
docker build -t musicbrainz-postgres .
```

Usage Instructions
------------------

The base recommended Docker command to run this container is...

```
docker run -t --rm 5432:5432 --name musicbrainz_postgres musicbrainz_postgres ...

```

If you have host-based storage available for the Postgres DB files
(recommended), adjust the base command accordingly:


```
docker run -t --rm  -v /path/to/storage/location:/var/lib/postgresql -p 5432:5432 --name musicbrainz_postgres musicbrainz_postgres ...
```

The rest of the instructions will refer to whatever your base command is as `<BASE COMMAND>`.


### Initialize Postgres database

You should only need to run this once:

```
<BASE COMMAND> /init.db
```

### Create database user for musicbrainz

You should only need to run this once:

```
<BASE COMMAND> /createuser.sh
```

### Start database server

```
<BASE COMMAND> /startdb.sh
```

You should be all set!
